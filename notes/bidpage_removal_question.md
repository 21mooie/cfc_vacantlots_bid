- maybe eventually get rid of bidpage? Do I even need it?
  - Depends on how much information I am willing to put in the bidPage
  - Depends on whether its a good idea to keep it there
  - Maybe get rid of bidview and integrate bid functionality?
  - Benefits of getting rid of bid page
    - Less reloading of the map?
    - Wouldnâ€™t have to switch views
    - Less jumpy for the user
    - The user would prefer to see all this info before bidding. Putting the info
    all in a bidpage breaks the flow of things. Though you could try to balance stuff.
    - I won't have to repeat any information or functionality in the bid page
    - Won't have to set up returning the current property
  - Drawbacks
    - Harder to display things while having all this map stuff in its way? May have responsive issues
    Though of course, I could put the bid content within the same infowindow, even hide and show stuff
    - More code seperation having them seperate
