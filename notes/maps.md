##  Ngmaps
  - Any bugs down the line will leave us dependent on the framework developers
    - We could always fork it though or contribute
  - Faster development

##  From scratch
  - Slower development
  - Not dependent on any other developers
  - Learn how the Googlemaps API works
  - Might be faster


##  Weird bug
  - It has something to do with calling the controller "map"
  - it was not the surrounding wrapper
  -

## Other Ngmap stuff
  - Ngmap forces 300px height blocks on map and has to be overridden. very weird
