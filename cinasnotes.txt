Cina's Notes

Map
    -map should be responsive and fully take up the remaining space
    -dummy properties should be loaded into the map
    -MapCtrl should work without having ng-controller in the view
    since the router already assigns the controller (but removing it
    stops it from working)
    

Do

    -Login page
    -Register page
    -Welcome should maybe just say map?
    -There should be a way back to the map

David Did

Bugs
    Bug-UI router needs to have a nicer URL; htmltrue,location provider
        and base cause errors; this problem doesn't exist on RouterProvider
        but does on UIrouter. Should I switch?
        
        
        
        
        
        

General Notes On Angular:
    Module: stores the different parts of the app (below)
        -Template: the view
            -directives: markers on a template
            that tells the Angular HTML compiler
            to attach special behavior
            to a DOM element.
            -Directives let you to write out logic onto HTML    
    
        -scope bind template and controller together,
        if anything is changed on either end is updated
            -Data gets set initially in the controller and into the scope
            -The template grabs from scope
            -when expressions change in template, controller is updated
    
        -controller: set up initial state and logic for A VIEW
            -service is closely tied to controller
            and lets you put view independent logic.
            Then you can use that service in many different
            controllers. A service can be used to fetch and
            store a user object. Services can be injected into
            controlllers.
                -dependency injection
    
        -Router: watches URL and loads the correct template
        into the controller.
